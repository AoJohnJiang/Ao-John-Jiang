# Ao-John-Jiang
PhD candidate at University of Leeds / Joint education of Ph.D at Imperial College London
I am Ao (John) Jiang, now a doctoral student at the School of Design at Leeds University. I supervised by Professor Stephen Westland , who is the Chair of the School of Color Science and Technology .and Dr. Tang Tang.

My research focuses on visual optimization in space environments (space habitats) and space station environments, helping astronauts (users) improve habitability through color and visual optimization, and researching visual optimization when designing products and spacecraft interiors. The application will help to create a comfortable, livable environment and enhance the astronauts' emotional adaptability. My previous research focused on the interaction design and integration design engineering between "human-machine (computer/mechanical)-environment-data-task". I have extensive experience in user research, human factors, usability assessment and testing, experimental design, UX/UI design, prototyping and evaluation, and industrial design engineering.

If you would like to know or share with me, please email me. very glad to hear from you!
